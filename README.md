# Ecommpay SalesForce Commerce Cloud (B2C) integration

Tested with SFRA version 6.0 - 6.3

## Integration guide

In order to process payments with actual debiting of funds, you should initially solve all organisational issues related to the interaction with ecommpay ([submit the application](https://ecommpay.com/apply-now/) for connecting to the payment platform, provide all necessary information, and receive a notification from ecommpay about the possibility to process payments, as well as the identifier and secret key of the production project). Along with that, it is necessary to provide the ecommpay technical support specialists with the name and URL of the web service for which the plug-in from ecommpay is set up and the currency in which payments are to be processed.
